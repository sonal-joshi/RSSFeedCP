# RSSFeedCP
This is a project for course COP5618-Concurrent Programming

Brief Description of the Project: 
  This project implements a RSS Feed Reader. Includes implementing the RSS Feed reader using sequential and concurrent methods. In the concurrent methods we have implemented direct mapping of tasks to threads using runnables and thread pool execution. Along with the direct mapping of tasks to threads we have implemented Fork Join Framework to map tasks to threads and join the results and Callables to which tasks are submitted and then received in Futures.
